## Project Description

The **3D Model Car Project** is a showcase of a meticulously crafted digital representation of the iconic *Porsche 911 Turbo 1975*. This project combines cutting-edge web technologies such as TypeScript, CSS, and HTML with the power of WebGL through the Three.js library to create an immersive and interactive experience for car enthusiasts. Check the different perspectives of the car by clicking on the different options.

### Features

- **Realistic Rendering**: Utilizing Three.js, the project brings the Porsche 911 Turbo 1975 to life with stunningly realistic 3D rendering, capturing every detail of the car's design. 

- **Interactive Camera**: Users can navigate around the car by selecting the different options of the car, for e.g, by clicking on "spoiler" option, the camera will smoothly move towards the spoiler showcasing it.

- **Animations**: The project employs Tween.js to create smooth animations, allowing for eye-catching transitions and effects. This enhances the overall user engagement and realism of the experience.


### How It Works

The project is built primarily using TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. TypeScript ensures a structured and maintainable codebase, while CSS styling is carefully crafted to enhance the visual appeal of the car model. HTML is used to structure the webpage and integrate the 3D model seamlessly.

Three.js is the backbone of the project, enabling the creation of the 3D scene, rendering the car model, and handling user interactions. Tween.js is employed to manage smooth animations, ensuring that transitions are visually pleasing and enhance the overall user experience.
